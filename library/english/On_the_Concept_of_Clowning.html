        <p class="variable">What is <b class="constant">clown logic</b>?</p>
        
        <p class="variable">This question, though ostensibly proper in its relative positioning, errs already by beginning <em class="constant">in media res</em>&mdash;so to speak&mdash;a common crime which can only ever be rectified by beginning at the beginning:</p>

        <p class="variable">What is <b class="constant">logic</b>?</p>

        <p class="variable">To answer the latter query will, I hope, bring us, that is, me & thou, dear reader, hopefully, or approximately, halfway to an sufficient answer worthy of answering to the former's heightened hubris; and, furthermore, our resultant holistic efficacy, if we should decide to work as a team toward any common goal (the present included), in arriving at such seemingly-impious answers will hinge almost-thoroughly upon two key clauses of that larger unspoken social contract which maintains its mighty jurisdiction over communications interpersonal:</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="variable">your (the dear reader) willingness to trust my honest intentions, and</li>
            <li class="variable">my (the annoying author) unwillingness to spin a lie, for any reason whatsoever, whether fiscal, sophistical, animal, vegetable, mineral, or otherwise.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="variable">To deign to begin at a point which is identically other than the known origin, i.e., the very beginning, is to apply the self-same temporal greed which that proverbial king once applied in surmising that he could have an heir in one-ninth the natural timeline if only nine women were tasked with producing the heir as a collective effort. Some things, it is said, truly do require patience; impatience doth not an optimal outcome make.</p>
