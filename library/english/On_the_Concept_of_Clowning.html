            <span class="quotation">"Something marvelous has happened to me. I was transported to the seventh heaven. There sat all the gods assembled. As a special dispensation, I was granted the favor of making a wish. 'What do you want,' asked Mercury. 'Do you want youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful girl, or any one of the other glorious things we have in the treasure chest? Choose&mdash;but only one thing.' For a moment I was bewildered; then I addressed the gods, saying: My esteemed contemporaries, I choose one thing&mdash;that I may always have the laughter on my side. Not one of the gods said a word; instead, all of them began to laugh. From that I concluded that my wish was granted and decided that the gods knew how to express themselves with good taste, for it would indeed have been inappropriate to reply solemnly: It is granted to you."</span><br>

        <p class="variable">What is <b class="constant">clown logic</b>?</p>
        
        <p class="variable">This question, though ostensibly proper in its relative positioning, errs already by beginning <em class="constant">in media res</em>&mdash;so to speak&mdash;a common crime which can only ever be rectified by beginning at the beginning:</p>

        <p class="variable">What is <b class="constant">logic</b>?</p>

        <p class="variable">To answer the latter query will, I hope, bring us, that is, me & thou, dear reader, hopefully, or approximately, halfway to an sufficient answer worthy of answering to the former's heightened hubris; and, furthermore, our resultant holistic efficacy, if we should decide to work as a team toward any common goal (the present included), in arriving at such seemingly-impious answers will hinge almost-thoroughly upon two key clauses of that larger unspoken social contract which maintains its mighty jurisdiction over communications interpersonal:</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="variable">your (<em class="constant">the dear reader's</em>) willingness to trust my honest (read: "Kantian") intentions, and</li>
            <li class="variable">my (<em class="constant">the annoying author's</em>) unwillingness to spin a lie, for any reason whatsoever, whether fiscal, sophistical, animal, vegetable, mineral, or otherwise, et cetera.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="variable">To deign to begin at a point which is identically other than the known origin, i.e., the very beginning, is to apply the self-same temporal greed which that proverbial king once applied in surmising that he could receive an heir in one-ninth the natural timeline if only nine women were tasked with producing the heir as a collective.</p>
        
        <p class="variable">Some things, it is said, truly do require patience; impatience doth not an optimal outcome make.</p>
