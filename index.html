        <h1>Logoi can be described as "an amateur logician's artificial programming language dialect",</h1>
        <br>
        <p>...though it was designed primarily for rapid adoption (i.e., syntactic minimalism), with an egregious emphasis on cognitive simplicity (i.e., aesthetic purity).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Logoi is indebted, as infinitely as equally, to the thought-provoking works of:<br><br>

        <h1>Eleven Laconic Laws of Logoi</h1>
        <br>
        <p>0</p>
        <br>
        <p>Infringement upon even a single logoi law is, given sufficient reason to suspect malicious intent, admittedly unpunishable for obvious reasons ethical and otherwise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>1</p>
        <br>
        <p>Any given law may be questioned at any time by any person for any reason.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2</p>
        <br>
        <p>Logoi files contain one list element per line.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3</p>
        <br>
        <p>Logoi files recognize depth-of-indentation as the canonical abstraction operator.</p>
        <br>
        <p>4</p>
        <br>
        <p>Any given law exists, at least in part, as a suggestion toward its own improvement.</p>
        <br>
        <p>5</p>
        <br>
        <p>"The Calculi of Lambda-Conversion" by A. Church and "Methods of Logic" by W. V. O. Quine together constitute the spiritual parentage of Logoi Linguistics and its consequences.</p>
        <br>
        <p>6</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fun and functional are not mutually exclusive.</p>
        <br>
        <p>7</p>
        <br>
        <p>This law is redundant, and is thereby willfully omissible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>8</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dark themes are ostensibly healthier for the environment in cases (OLED) where electricity consumption is reduced for some sets of darker colors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>9</p>
        <br>
        <p>Socrates did nothing wrong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>10</p>
        <br>
        <p>Esperanto is the official language of Logoi Linguistics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>11</p>
        <br>
        <p>Logic is the art of emotionlessness.</p>
