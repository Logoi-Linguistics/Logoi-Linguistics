        <p>Logoi Linguistics is a founding contributor toward Logoi's initial language design and its prototypical web editor.</p>

        <h1>Logoi can be described as "an amateur linguist's artificial programming language designed specifically for automatic ratiocination, with an egregious emphasis on cognitive simplicity".</h1>
        <br>
        <p>"What is a language?" This question was contemplated daily for six months, and the final result was Logoi.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Logoi is infinitely indebted, in no particular order, to the writings of John McCarthy, Alonzo Church, Willard van Orman Quine, George Boole, and countless other Logicians Proper.</p>
