        <p>"What is Logoi, exactly?"</p>

        <p>Logoi is the Greek word for "words".</p>
        
        <p>"No, not etymologically. Logically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is Prolog and Lisp.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not synthetically. Pragmatically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is an artificial language and an extensible editor.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not empirically. Concisely."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is Logoi.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not tautologically. Precisly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a dialectic dissertation upon the automation of pure reason.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not philosophically. Plainly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a toy for the mind.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not aesthetically. Practically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is an automation of human language as it exists.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not egomaniacally. Fairly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is an imprecise chemical mixture of the predicate and lambda calucli.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not facetiously. Sincerely."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is the absurd delusion of an amateur logician.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not literally. Concretely."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is yet another optical illusion that synchronizes the fingers/mind with the screen/machine.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not ironically. Wholeheartedly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a mathematical exercise in the teaching of machines to communicate fluently in a logical dialect of any human language.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not prolixly. Tersely."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a logic mentor.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not aspirationally. Realistically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is an unholy offspring of the writings of Boole, Church, Quine, et. al.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not pejoratively. Genuinely."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a love letter to humanity.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not weirdly. Earnestly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is like an onion in that it makes you cry and it has countless layers.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not Romantically. Mathematically."</p>
        
        <p>'= L + LP FP', where L = Logoi, LP = Logical Programming, FP = Functional Programming.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not symbolically. Declaratively."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is the artful science of applied semiology.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not playfully. Strictly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is the latest Icarian venture into the blistering rays of epistemology.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not harshly. Directly."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is an impractical joke by an eccentric autodidact.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not existentially. Ontologically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a web-first framework for knowledge programming.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not vicariously. Purposefully."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is mere syntactic sugar.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not pessimistically. Emphatically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a democratization of programming by way of turning one's native language into a programming language.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not hyperbolically. Factually."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a state of mind.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not esoterically. Exoterically."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a programming language.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not reductively. Respectfully."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a opinionated syntax rewriter targeting LIPS Scheme and SWI-Prolog, and is entirely indebted to these and countless other technological communities.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not objectively. Subjectively."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is the incoherent incarnation of a curious desire to talk with an artificial replica of myself.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not diabolically. Humanely."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi relates to logic just as a calculator relates to math.</p>
        
        <p>"No, not analogically. Universally."</p>
        
        <p>Logoi is a well-intentioned effort to teach computers to be fluent in every spoken language.</p>
